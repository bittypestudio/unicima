## The Story Begins

Thursday, June 12, 2025

It has been exactly a year since I graduated, and I'm still unemployed. No job offers, no calls, and not a single opportunity that fits me. In the middle of this uncertainty, I decided to try something different—to create a digital product, specifically, a **font**. I had no idea where to begin, and I didn’t think I was good enough compared to others out there.

I tend to get bored easily. I love trying new things, which makes it difficult to focus deeply on a single skill. I feel like a platypus—having many traits but mastering none. My first font, called **BitSerif**, was inspired by Google Fonts serif styles. I published it on DaFont and other platforms, but no response, no feedback—just silence.

I used to apply for jobs everywhere. The results? Disappointments, rejection, and guilt for becoming a burden on my mother. To cope with that sadness, I browsed through DaFont for inspiration and stumbled upon **MineDings** by *The Dab Master*. Each letter in MineDings represented a Minecraft item. That font was so creative and niche—it sparked something in me.

I also found **Morse Code** by *Alessio D’Amico*—a brilliant font based on morse symbols using geometric circles. That was when I started experimenting with morse-based fonts. But something was missing... I wanted something **universal**, **complete**, and **self-contained**.

So, I turned to ChatGPT and explored a more global structure: **Unicode**—more specifically, its **decimal ID** system. From that, the seed of a new font was planted. I called it:

## Unicima's Story

UNICIMA is based on the idea that every character (glyph) represents its Unicode decimal ID. Since those IDs are numeric, I started by designing digits 1–9 as symbols. My first two symbols were simple vertical lines, the next few had diagonal strokes, and all followed a logic based on how many corners (or angles) they visually represented.

That's how UNICIMA was born: a language system using logic and structure, not just aesthetics.

To make it more than just a font, I created its own **alphabet**—a structure I call **CobolType**, short for:


- `Code-Based`: Because it's rooted in Unicode numbers.
- `Orthographic`: Because it's a written system.
- `Language`: Because it aims to grow into a full, expressive, open-source script.

Later, I developed **syntax rules** inspired by programming languages like C++ and Python. I invented my own symbols:  
→ **SyntaFinder**, **Syntator (Syntactic Separator)**, **Negation**, **Meaning**, **Go To**, **Majh (Anonym)**, **Dink**, and **Dark Dink**.

## The End of The Story

UNICIMA is not just a typeface. It's a form of expression, a new way to communicate, a space where abstract meets purpose.

I created it not to go viral, not to be trendy, but to prove something deep:  
> *Creativity does not require rebellion.*

I’m a Muslim. In my faith, there are clear boundaries—avoiding music, avoiding sensual or vulgar imagery, avoiding immoral expressions. But instead of seeing those as **chains**, I see them as **direction**. As **purpose**.

> **Boundaries are not walls. They are compasses.**

UNICIMA is my answer to the idea that creativity requires crossing the line.  
It doesn't.  
With UNICIMA, I didn’t need explicit visuals, animated characters, or offensive aesthetics. Just form. Structure. Symbols. Logic. Meaning.

I hope this font inspires others—especially those who feel constrained by their faith, finances, or lack of tools—to know:  
> **You don’t have to cross the line to create something meaningful.**
